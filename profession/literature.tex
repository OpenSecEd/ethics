This assignment is based on the Codes of Ethics of two engineering 
associations.
Thus, before you start you must read
\citetitle{acmcode}~\cite{acmcode},
\citetitle{acmsecode}~\cite{acmsecode}, and finally
\citetitle{ieeecode}~\cite{ieeecode}.

Once you have read this you should read two articles analysing Snowden's 
revelations about the NSA surveillance techniques.
The first one is \citetitle{landau2013snowden}~\cite{landau2013snowden}.
The second one is \citetitle{landau2013snowden}~\cite{landau2014highlights}.
Finally, in your favourite search engine, search for the string
\begin{center}
	``nsa exploit of the day site:www.schneier.com''.
\end{center}
Read about a few of the NSA exploits presented there.

Lastly, you should read about the \enquote{famous} Apple versus FBI case, where
FBI wants Apple to engineer a weakened version of iOS so the FBI can break its 
security.
In particular you should read the article 
\citetitle{AppleEngineersRebel}~\cite{AppleEngineersRebel}.
