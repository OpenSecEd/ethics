To be able to reason and have a discussion, we will have some ethics guidelines 
as a base:
\citetitle{acmcode}~\cite{acmcode},
\citetitle{acmsecode}~\cite{acmsecode} and
\citetitle{ieeecode}~\cite{ieeecode}.

First, you must read up on the influence campaigns during the 2016 US 
election~\cite{inside-russian-influence-campaign}.
Then you must read up on the Cambridge Analytica scandal~\cite[\eg][]{%
  wired-cambridge-analytica,
  guardian-cambridge-analytica,
  nytimes-cambridge-analytica,
  wp-cambridge-analytica,
} and the Mirai botnet incident~\cite{schneier-mirai}.

Finally, you should search for and read current news articles of your own 
choice illustrating the problem of lacking security.
