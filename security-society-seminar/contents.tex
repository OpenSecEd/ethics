\section{Introduction}

Our world becomes increasingly dependent on computer systems, it is thus 
important that those who can affect these systems do that in a responsible 
way.
But what is a responsible way, what are the limits?
This is the topic of ethics, the reasoning about moral obligations.
The purpose of this seminar is to discuss what those responsibilities are and 
where the limits are.

%There are various examples that illustrate the problems caused by lacking 
%security.
%For example, since our digital world allows the copying of information more 
%easily, more people do this.
%This can happen in the form of people using a service for publishing 
%photographs to friends, or to the entire world for that matter.
%Even this innocuous activity can cause problems:
%for instance, when a child posted vacation pictures to 
%Instagram~\cite{Roberts2012wia}.
%This happened to be not any child, it reached the news only because the child 
%was a member of the Norwegian royal family.
%These images posted, did due to our technical development, contain the exact 
%GPS coordinates of the location where the picture was taken.
%The result was that the position of the royal family was published in almost 
%real-time, information which is normally strictly secret.
%However, this is also an issue for non-celebrities: a family was robbed in 
%their house due to a sales advertisement~\cite{BlocketRobbery}.


\section{Aims}

This seminar aims for reflection of how security, or lack thereof, affects 
products, people, society and discuss the responsibilities of engineers.
After doing this assignment your should be able to:

\section{Assignment}%
\label{sec:Tasks}

Search for some news articles about security: they could be articles about how 
lack of security caused real problems.
There are lots of such news stories out there, pick your favourite and make a 
one-slide presentation (\eg a news front page).

During the seminar you should present your news article: shortly summarize it 
(less than five minutes), discuss why this is a problem (\eg what are the 
consequences?), how easily or difficultly this could be prevented and finally 
whose responsibility it is to prevent such problems.

Next, read up on the Cambridge Analytica scandal~\cite[\eg][]{%
  wired-cambridge-analytica,
  guardian-cambridge-analytica,
  nytimes-cambridge-analytica,
  wp-cambridge-analytica,
} and an analysis of the Mirai botnet incident~\cite{schneier-mirai}.

Use the codes of ethics~\cite{acmcode,acmsecode,ieeecode} as a base to reflect 
on the questions: Where does the responsibility of the engineers who 
contributed to these systems end?
Should they be morally obliged to ensure the user can make an informed choice?
Or is that totally the responsibility of the user?
What if the design does not let the user make an informed choice?
What if the design intentionally deceives the user to make the \enquote{wrong} 
choice?
If there is no regulation in law, is anything allowed?


\section{Assessment}%
\label{Assessment}

This assignment is assessed through active participation in a seminar.
To prepare for this seminar, follow the instructions in \cref{sec:Tasks}.
Write down your reasoning and discussion, that will be valuable support during 
the seminar.
You must participate actively to pass this assessment.
